Several Least Authority employees are members of the Tahoe-LAFS development community.  Tahoe-LAFS is highly regarded in the privacy technology and liberation tech communities.  Several spontaneous efforts technical efforts demonstrate this, such as a recent effort to integrate Tahoe-LAFS with Tor as well as I2P, and to integrate it as part of the Tails project.

In addition to *technical* efforts centered around Tahoe-LAFS, Least Authority has engaged relationships with multiple Internet freedom communities on a social and business level.  We've interacted with many OTF project teams through events and contracted work on security auditing and engineering contracts.  We've worked under OTF contracts with GlobaLeaks, CryptoCat, and Tor via the OONI Project.

Additionally we have good relationships with Internet freedom organizations working in similar technical areas, such as Benetech (with whom we've discussed potential joint efforts between Tahoe-LAFS and the Martus project), the LEAP project, Whisper Systems, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

In addition to our interactions with nonprofit technology developers in the internet freedom space, we also have relationships in the business sector with privacy- and/or security- oriented technology companies and organizations, such as Mozilla, SpiderOak, Coinbase, and DARPA.
