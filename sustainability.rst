Tahoe-LAFS is a thriving Free and Open Source project which has
garnered praise, support, and contributions from many sources (see the
“Community Interaction” section). We expect that the successful
completion of the Magic Folders project will stimulate even greater
enthusiasm from such contributors.

LeastAuthority's plan is to contribute the results of the OTF-funded Magic
Folders project immediately into the Free and Open Source codebase, and to
widely publicize it as a possible solution for those people who have been
asking for a secure and Open Source alternative to Dropbox.

In the future we intend to streamline the integration with Tor and the TAILS
image to provide privacy-compatible storage features for that ecosystem.
