All of the Objectives 1 through 6 will be implemented according to our
traditional development practices: a bunch of coders sitting around typing on
their laptops and chatting in IRC, mailing list, and issue tracker,
punctuated by a weekly video-conference. Therefore there will be no special
activities required to achieve these objectives.
